# Search methods

This mini-project was developed for the Artificial Intelligence and Decision Systems course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST). It addresses the problem of scheduling the launch of components for the in orbit assembly of a large structure. Given a set of components to be launched, a launch timeline and costs, and a construction plan, the goal is to determine the assignment of components to launches, such as the total cost is minimized. Read the [assignment description](assignment-details.pdf) for more details.

Two search methods are available with the objective of finding a solution. The search method is specified by a flag as a command line argument:
* (-u) uninformed search method - Uniform Cost Search
* (-i) informed search method - A*

The filename containing the problem specification is also a command line argument.

## Running the tests

For instance, to test the informed search method given the input present in the [mir](tests/mir.txt) file one may run 
```
python solver.py -i tests/mir.txt
```
